# JavaFX Example Project

The aim of this project is to help me explore the workings of the JavaFX GUI framework.
It will contain example files and potentially custom created API code.

## IDE
Intellij was used to create the project. I have kept the IDE files in VCS because the initial setup required some research.
This is also the reason why the run configuration was exported to a separate folder. This way it can be inspected and reused.
